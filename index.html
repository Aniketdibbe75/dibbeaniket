            <p>No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom to choose
                your toppings - from paneer, crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn, black olives, fresh
                tomato, red paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg toppings such as pepper barbeque
                chicken, peri-peri chicken, grilled chicken rasher, chicken sausage or chicken tikka- the options are
                almost endless, anything and everything you can think of that too on top of the crust of your choice -
                New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin crust, cheese burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan
                pizza. Because just like a pizza, Domino's understands you.

                <h3>Burger</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Burger King (BK) is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. Headquartered in
                Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville,
                Florida–based restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties in 1954, its two
                Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton and James McLamore purchased the company and renamed it "Burger
                King". Over the next half-century, the company changed hands four times, with its third set of owners, a
                partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, taking it public in 2002.
                In late 2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company, in a deal valued at US$3.26
                billion. The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G,
                along with partner Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut
                chain Tim Hortons, under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands
                International.</p>

            <p>Burger King's menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas, and milkshakes to
                a larger and more diverse set of products. In 1957, the "Whopper" became the first major addition to the
                menu, and it has become Burger King's signature product since. Conversely, Burger King has introduced
                many products which failed to catch hold in the marketplace. Some of these failures in the United States
                have seen success in foreign markets, where Burger King has also tailored its menu for regional tastes.
                From 2002 to 2010, Burger King aggressively targeted the 18–34 male demographic with larger products
                that often carried correspondingly large amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats. This tactic would
                eventually damage the company's financial underpinnings, and cast a negative pall on its earnings.
                Beginning in 2011, the company began to move away from its previous male-oriented menu and introduce new
                menu items, product reformulations and packaging, as part of its current o</p>

                <h3>Soft-Drinks</h3>
            </div>
            <p>A soft drink (see § Terminology for other names) is a drink that usually contains water (often
                carbonated), a sweetener, and a natural and/or artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be a sugar,
                high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet drinks), or some
                combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and/or other
                ingredients.

                Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks. Small amounts of alcohol may be
                present in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink
                in many countries and localities[1][2] if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic.[3] Fruit punch,
                tea (even kombucha), and other such non-alcoholic drinks are technically soft drinks by this definition,
                but are not generally referred to as such.</p>

            <p>Soft drinks are mixed with other ingredients in several contexts. In Western countries, in bars and other
                places where alcohol is served (e.g. airplanes, restaurants and nightclubs), many mixed drinks are made
                by blending a soft drink with hard liquor and serving the drink over ice. One well-known example is the
                rum and coke, which may also contain lime juice. Some homemade fruit punch recipes, which may or may not
                contain alcohol, contain a mixture of various fruit juices and a soft drink (e.g. ginger ale). At ice
                cream parlors and 1950s-themed diners, ice cream floats consisting of a soft drink poured over ice
                cream, such as root beer floats, are often sold. Some types of soft drinks are lemon-lime drinks, orange
                soda, cola, grape soda, and root beer.</p>
